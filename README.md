Chatbot project based on A3 Chatbot

Just like "Professor" Tom likes to play good selection of music right before the lecture starts, I too love playing music to get into mood for studying! Sometimes I would like to talk about my favorite bands of music genre of my choice. 

This chatbot called "DROCK" will chat with you about wonders of the music worls such as favorite guitarist, cool bass players, drummers, band gears, history of music, and more!

This assignment is based on ChatBots Assignment that was done previously for A3. On top of Chatbot assignment, you can now select between genres to have specific conversation between "rock" and "pop".

Depending on which genre you choose, the chatbot will stimulate interesting facts and topics specific to that genre!
